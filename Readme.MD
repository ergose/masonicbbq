Current status/notes:
- Still being casually developed in free time.
- Converted to mobile first from where I had tried the opposite.
- Cleaned up the Sass and tried reorganizing it based on SMACSS.
- Graphic theme works well on mobile now.
- Google form was retooled/Form now works with Google spreadsheet. Technique works and is linked to one of my accounts for testing.

TODO when I get some time again: 
- Images have not been optimized much yet
- Contact form backend is not ready yet. (Will likely use "sendmail" for Node.js. No mail account is required to send like with PHP.)
- Optimize of Bootstrap by what was used, setup uglify, etc. The interface with Bootstrap is pretty solid, it's only the guts that need to be made production ready at this point.
